### Code
- Finish server
- Test client's error handling
  - RabbitMQ disconnection - does cleanup happen correctly?

### Documentation
- README.txt (done)
  - Ensure dependencies are updated once server is finished

  include a chronological description of what events take place and when the 
  events are taking place.

- Objective of assignment
- Our approach
  - Detailed description
    - What happens when your client connects?
    - What happens when your client disconnects?
- Challenges and obstacles
- Overcoming challenges
